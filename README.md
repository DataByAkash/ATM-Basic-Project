# 🏦 Basic ATM Project in Python

This is a simple command-line based ATM system I built while learning Python.

---

## 💡 Why I Made This

I wanted to understand how basic ATM operations work in real life and also wanted to apply what I’m learning in Python. This project helped me practice functions, conditional logic, and user input handling step by step.

## 🔧 Features I Implemented

1. **Show Account Balance** – User enters a PIN to check their balance.
2. **Cash Deposit** – User enters account number and adds cash using denominations like 2000, 500, etc.
3. **Cash Withdrawal** – Withdraw cash after PIN verification and check for balance & limits.
4. **PIN Change** – User can change their PIN after verifying the old one.

## 🧠 What I Learned (Step by Step)

- How to use `input()` and interact with users through the console.
- Writing and calling **functions** in Python.
- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision making.
- How to **check for correct pin/account number** before allowing any transaction.
- Using **variables to track balance** and update after deposit/withdrawal.
- Returning values from functions to update global variables like balance or pin.
- How to handle **invalid inputs** and show meaningful messages.
- Keeping the code organized and readable.
- How to think like a developer while solving real-life inspired problems.

## ✅ Final Note

This project may be basic, but it's an important step in my journey to become a Python developer and a data analyst. I'm learning by building, one small project at a time.
